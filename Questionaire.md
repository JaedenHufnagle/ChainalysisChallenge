# Questionaire

# Question 1:

There were a few sub-optimal choices I took to finish this project in the required time frame. First I didn't have a whole lot of time to do extensive research on API calls to figure out which one would work the best for me. On top of that I didn't have an extensive amount of time to read through all the documentation to fully comprehend the API. Also one of my API's didn't have a clear sell price so I had to calculate the sell price of both currencies. Outside of those two main issues, my website doesn't cut corners in terms of display or design.

# Question 2:

My front end of my website is slightly over designed. This is allow for some interpetation as to what would happen in a later iteration of the website. I referenced an HTML and CSS layout to help with a more intuitive UI friendly design for my page. I even went so far as to use an external program to help with formatting a mobile view of the webpage. Otherwise, I'd argue my back-end is very minimalisitc and doesn't have more to it than what's necessary to complete the assignment.

# Question 3:

There are a few changes I'd make to my website to better handle 100 users/second. To start I'd have a more buisness oriented API that allows me to make many sucessive calls in such a short time span. Most API's want a licence for more production quality webpages. Also, I'd have more guidance for users if they have questions. Perhaps a support page or some kind of contact us page instead of the little bit currently at the bottom of my page.

# Question 4:

There are a few enhancements I'd make. Starting off I'd like a user support page. From there I'd like to add a graphic to represent the trend of Bitcoin and Ethereum prices over time to give the user an idea of how they're currenty trending. I'd like to have better functioning APIs that are more suited to the task, or perhaps a better understanding of the ones I choose to use for this challenge. Also I'd like to maybe include another popular crypto to make the app more useful than just the two most popular currencies.
