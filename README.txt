For this project you'll need to use Python Flask as your backend service to host the web app.
To start you'll need to make sure you have Flask downloaded and installed on your system.
I recommend you follow this tutorial: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/installation/
Once that is all set up you need to be careful to not move any files from the folders used in the GitHub (i.e leave the static and templates folders alone, and the app outside both folders)
In this repository I have also included a requirements.txt file which has all the required dependenceis used in my own Venv to run the program.
To run once all the dependenceis are installed you can run your app using either flask run or if an issue occurs python -m flask run will work too.
If any questions or concerns about running the app contact me at jaedenhufnagle977@gmail.com
